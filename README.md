# The Cotton Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning** project uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and transfer learning to identify and classify different diseases in cotton plants by analyzing images. The model is trained on a variety of cotton plant images to improve its accuracy. Additionally, the project includes a chatbot that interacts with users once a disease is detected. This chatbot provides helpful information about the identified disease, such as its causes, symptoms, and treatment options. This easy-to-use solution helps farmers get timely information, allowing them to make better decisions to protect their crops and improve farming results.

### Frontend (React):
1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npx create-react-app cotton-disease-predictor
   cd cotton-disease-predictor
   npm install axios
   ```

2. **Run React App:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **Make API Call to Backend:**
   - Use `axios` to send a POST request with an image to the backend:
     ```javascript
     axios.post('/api/predict', formData).then(response => {
       setResult(response.data);
     });
     ```

### Backend (Node.js with Express and Flask):
4. **Set Up Backend (Node.js + Express):**
   ```bash
   npm init
   npm install express multer axios cors
   ```

5. **Start Node.js Server:**
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

6. **Connect to Flask ML Model:**
   - Use `axios` in the Node.js backend to communicate with Flask:
     ```javascript
     axios.post('http://localhost:5000/predict', imageFile).then(response => {
       res.json(response.data);
     });
     ```

7. **Run Flask Server:**
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

### Steps Summary:
1. `npx create-react-app`, install frontend dependencies.
2. Start React app with `npm start`.
3. Use `axios` for API requests to the backend.
4. Initialize Node.js backend with Express and necessary libraries.
5. Start the Node.js server.
6. Set up communication between Node.js and Flask using `axios`.
7. Start the Flask server for the machine learning model.
